# Project
Aero 470 Simulation Project // 3D Boids // by George Harrison, Danilo Carrasco, and Peter Kim

**Title**

**Abstract**
Boids in 3D that showcase: seperation, alignment, cohesion
A hawk will be introduced that will chase the boids and the boids will avoid
The simulation will happen in a limited 3D space for a limited duration of time.

**Introduction**

**Methodology**

**Results**
**Conclusion**

**Danilo's Problem Statement**

Design boids algorith that allows the individual control of each these parameters

Variable (Tailorable):

- Separation

- Alignment

- Cohesion
    - Visual range

- Object avoidance

- Predator
    - Chase boids, maybe pick an individual boid
    - Optional: allow user to control predator

Constants:

- 3D

- Voids are turned in their velocity vector direction
